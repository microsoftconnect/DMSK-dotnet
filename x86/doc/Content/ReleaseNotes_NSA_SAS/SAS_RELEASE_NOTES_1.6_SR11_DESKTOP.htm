        <h1>Release Notes for 360&#160;|&#160;SpeechAnywhere Services 1.6 Service Release 11 (.NET edition)</h1>
        <h2>Solved issues in service release 11</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Applications are no longer prevented from reconnecting to the SAS Server after a session timeout in suboptimal network environments. [PSP00075746, PSP00078705]</li>
            <li>Dragon-based systems: The handling of text deletion while recognition results are pending has been improved. [PSP00076130]</li>
            <li>Adding a natively-supported text control to a form and immediately enabling it after recognition has been performed in a custom control no longer causes the application to stop responding. [PSP00077699]</li>
            <li>When multiple instances of an application are open, it is now clearer which speech bar corresponds to the instance with the focus. [PSP00076672]</li>
            <li>The speech bar is no longer displayed off-screen in some circumstances when the application starts. [PSP00078259]</li>
            <li>The speech bar no longer removes the focus from an application when clicked. [PSP00077841]</li>
            <li>The design of the speech bar has been improved to work better in Citrix environments. [PSP00074956]</li>
            <li>Information has been added to the .NET edition SDK Help on how to receive command events. [PSP00070981]</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="note"><b>Note:</b> For information on previous service releases, see <a href="#Service_release_history">below</a>.</p>
        <h2>New in version 1.6 service release 11</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The design of the speech bar and options menu has been improved. [PSP00077120, PSP00079184]</li>
            <li>
                <p>The speech bar is now customizable. Your integration can set the background color, background image, border image, button images and start position. To access the speech bar functionality, the .NET edition SDK has been extended with a new Windows Forms API and a new WPF API.&#160;The types and conventions of the new APIs match those of their respective UI frameworks but they are otherwise identical. Either can be used in any application. Windows Forms API example:</p>
                <p>Setting the initial position of the speech bar so that the upper left corner aligns to the (100, 100) position:</p>
                <p class="indent2"><code>SpeechBar.SharedSpeechBar.SetInitialPosition(100, 100, true, true);</code>
                </p>
                <p>Overriding the default button backgrounds (assuming the images are resources of the application):</p>
                <p class="indent2"><code>SpeechBar.SharedSpeechBar.SetBackgroundImage(Nuance.SpeechAnywhere.BackgroundImageType.RecordButtonOffNormal, Properties.Resources.recbutton_default);</code>
                </p>
                <p class="indent2"><code>SpeechBar.SharedSpeechBar.SetBackgroundImage(Nuance.SpeechAnywhere.BackgroundImageType.RecordButtonOffHover, Properties.Resources.recbutton_default_hover);</code>
                </p>
                <p>For more information, see the API reference documentation and the sample application. [PSP00077120, PSP00075828, PSP00062206, PSP00079341]</p>
            </li>
            <li>Commands and actions can now be assigned to all available function buttons on Philips SpeechMike III and SpeechMike Premium devices. The <code>ControlDeviceEvent</code> enumeration has been extended to include values <code>Button4Pressed</code>, <code>Button5Pressed</code>, up to <code>Button8Pressed</code>. [PSP00078139]</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="note"><b>Note:</b> For information on previous service releases, see <a href="#Service_release_history">below</a>.</p>
        <h2>Important information in version 1.6</h2>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
            <li>Please be aware that your application must be recompiled following this upgrade.</li>
            <li>360 | SpeechAnywhere Services 1.6 Server is compatible with client versions 1.4, 1.5 and 1.6.</li>
            <li>360 | SpeechAnywhere Services 1.6 (.NET edition) is compatible with SAS Server versions 1.4, 1.5 and 1.6.</li>
            <li>The <code>ErrorOccurred</code> event is deprecated and will be removed in 360&#160;|&#160;SpeechAnywhere Services 1.7.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>New in version 1.6</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Voice editing functionality has been extended with select &amp; say voice commands (Dragon-based systems only).</li>
            <li>Text formatting has been improved. When text is inserted, the spacing is correctly updated and surrounding text is correctly capitalized (Dragon-based systems only).</li>
            <li>SAS clients can now use Dragon customization packs (.dat files) containing Text-and-Graphics/auto-texts without lists. You can import and share .dat files via the Nuance Management Console.</li>
            <li>The .NET edition has a new speech bar with an options button, a volume meter and a start/stop recording button. This replaces the speech bubble from earlier versions. It can be freely positioned by the end user. It remains on the Windows desktop when the speech-enabled application is minimized.</li>
            <li>The .NET edition has a new custom text control interface; it is now possible to speech-enable any text control in your application.</li>

            <li>The automatic gain control (AGC) of the recording device or the device drivers/sound card drivers interferes with the SpeechAnywhere Services automatic audio adjustment feature. <b>Solution:</b> Disable the interfering AGCs.</li>
            <li>The <code>SpokenText</code> parameter in the <code>CommandRecognized</code> event is empty in command mode. [PSP00062085]</li>

        <h3>Remarks</h3>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
            <li>Virtual environments: For full support of virtual platforms, a custom audio channel needs to be deployed both on the platform client and platform server. For more information, see the custom audio channel deployment package in the SpeechMagic package or on the <a href="http://www.nuancehealthcaredeveloper.com">Nuance Healthcare Development Platform</a>.</li>
            <li>Citrix and Microsoft RDS environments: For microphone button support, third-party drivers for Philips, Grundig and Olympus devices need to be provided by the device vendor and deployed both on the Citrix/RDS client and Citrix/RDS server. For Nuance PowerMic devices, drivers also need to be deployed on the Citrix/RDS client and server and are included with the SpeechMagic package  or with the driver package on the <a href="http://www.nuancehealthcaredeveloper.com">Nuance Healthcare Development Platform</a>.</li>
            <li>For Citrix XenDesktop, third-party drivers for Philips, Grundig and Olympus devices are not available at the time of the 360 | SpeechAnywhere Services 1.6 release. Contact your device vendor for updated drivers with XenDesktop support.</li>
            <li>VMware environments: For more information on system configuration, see the <a href="http://kb.vmware.com/selfservice/microsites/search.do?language=en_US&amp;cmd=displayKC&amp;externalId=2068447">VMware Knowledge Base (Article ID 2068447)</a>.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>*End-of-life: third party environments</h3>
        <p>Support for third party environments is only valid as long as they are supported by the corresponding vendor and might be subject to other restrictions. Please contact Nuance Technical Support for details. For more information, see the documentation delivered with the third party product and supporting Nuance documentation.</p>
        <p>When support by the vendor has stopped, Nuance will continue support if an issue is specific to the Nuance solution, within the limitations of the vendor’s and Nuance's end-of-life policy. This means that issues that are a combination of the vendor’s component and the Nuance solution cannot be supported.</p>
